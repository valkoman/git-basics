Track lisiting:

A RUSH AND A PUSH AND THE LAND IS OURS
I STARTED SOMETHING THAT I COULDN'T FINISH
DEATH OF A DISCO DANCER
GIRLFRIEND IN A COMA
STOP ME IF YOU THINK YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE
LAST NIGHT I DREAMT THAT SOMEBODY LOVED ME
UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY
PAINT A VULGAR PICTURE
DEATH AT ONE'S ELBOW
I WON'T SHARE YOU

    Love, peace and harmony?
    Love, peace and harmony?
    Oh, very nice
    Very nice
    Very nice
    ...But maybe in the next world

    - Death Of A Disco Dancer
